# CO2-Gadget

**CO2-Gadget** is an advanced firmware for CO2 Monitors/Meters based on ESP32. It's designed for flexibility, supporting a variety of popular sensors, displays, and communication protocols. With features like real-time visualization, data logging, and over-the-air updates, CO2-Gadget is perfect for both developers and end-users looking to monitor air quality effectively.

It's really flexible, you can use this firmware with **any supported CO2 Monitor/Meter** based on ESP32 (99% of them).

With cell phone App for real time visualization and charting of air quality data, datalogger, a variety of communication options (BLE, WIFI, MQTT, ESP-NOW) and many supported popular sensors.

This repository is mainly addressed at developers. If you are an end user willing to install and use the CO2 Gadget firmware, you will find complete instructions at [my blog](https://emariete.com/en/co2-meter-gadget/) including instructions in how to install the firmware very easily, with just two clicks in your browser (without having edit files, compile or install anything on your computer).

If you don't have a CO2 Monitor you will also find some complete tutorials to build your own.

# Installing

Installing the CO2 Gadget advanced firmware on the board with the ESP32is super easy. You don't have to download or install anything on your PC.

Just click the button corresponding to the version you want to install, select the port where your board is connected and click "Connect". It's as simple as that, the uploading into the ESP32 will be done in a few seconds without any further complication with only a few clicks...

Visit the [CO2 Gadget page](https://emariete.com/en/meter-co2-gadget/) to install from the comfort of your internet browser.


# Building from Repository

## Using PlatformIO (Recommended)

If you're looking to compile and install CO2 Gadget from its repository, PlatformIO is the preferred method. However, if you only aim to install CO2 Gadget onto your board, you can do so directly from [here](https://emariete.com/en/meter-co2-gadget/) without compiling the firmware.

### Installation Steps

You have two options for utilizing PlatformIO: either through its Command Line Interface (CLI) or via Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with PlatformIO's Graphical User Interface (GUI). Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html).

### Preparing PlatformIO

Before proceeding, make sure to configure your preferences by editing the `platformio.ini` file, which is well-documented for easy customization. If required, adjust the upload and monitoring port configurations to match your setup.

```ini
upload_speed = 921600
monitor_speed = 115200
upload_port = COM13
monitor_port = COM13
```

Save the changes made to the `platformio.ini` file.

#### Compiling and Installation Process

For ease of use, PlatformIO is recommended over the Arduino IDE. After installing PlatformIO and its command line tools on your system (compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux), connect your compatible board via USB and execute the following command:

```bash
pio run -e TTGO_TDISPLAY --target upload
```

Ensure to replace "TTGO_TDISPLAY" with the desired flavor of CO2 Gadget to be compiled and uploaded. You can find these flavors defined in the `platformio.ini` file or define your own.

If using the PlatformIO GUI, follow these steps to compile and upload CO2-Gadget onto your board: press the "Alien head" icon, navigate to Project tasks, select your desired flavor, and choose Upload and Monitor.

## Using Arduino

**Note:**
At present, Arduino IDE is not supported. Should you wish to compile using the Arduino IDE, you will need to address includes, dependencies, and defines independently.

It's recommended to utilize VS Code with PlatformIO instead. Numerous tutorials are available online, simplifying the process considerably.
